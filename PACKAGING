A general-purpose python install:
* python setup.py install

To build the windows installer:
* \python27\python.exe setup.py py2exe -d windist
* Copy the gtk-2.0 directory from a previous installation into
  the windist directory.
* Compile setup.nsi
  (You will need NSIS, and the ShellLink plugin from
   http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ShellLink_plug-in)

To build the debian package: (The version numbers are just to give you an idea)
* python2.6 setup.py sdist
* mkdir packaging
* cd packaging
* cp ../dist/dreampie-0.9.tar.gz dreampie_0.9.orig.tar.gz
* tar -xvzf dreampie_0.9.orig.tar.gz
* Copy the 'debian' directory from the previous package into dreampie-0.9
* cd dreampie-0.9/debian
* dch -i (update version number, write something like "update to upstream")
* cd ..
* To create a source package:
    debuild -S
  To create a binary package:
    dpkg-buildpackage (Add -us -uc if you don't have a private key set up)
